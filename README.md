# Efficient execution of interpreted languages in the cloud
Tools and code related to the "Efficient execution of interpreted languages in the cloud" project

The PinTool provided is used to label memory loads connected to the loading a bytecode when running Python code in CPython (v 3.11).

`./pin -t tool_path.../MyFirstPinTool.so -o output_path -- python3.11 python_program.py`

This will result in a file at *tool_path* containg the memory loads labeled as connected to bytecode loading.

The analysis folder contains the benchmark-programs used in testing the Pin Tool, the Python script used to analyse its results and the filechanges made to CPythons v3.11 source code to make it a "Gold-Model". 

To run the python script you will have to add three command line arguments: path to debug file generated by modified CPython, the output of the PinTool, and output path.
